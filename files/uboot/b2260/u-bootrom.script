# u-bootrom supports u-boot.2015 commands plus few extras.
#
# Extra variables:
#   script_dev_usb    'usb X.Y'  default usb instance:partition to boot from.
#   script_dev_mmc    'mmc X.Y'  default mmc instance:partition to boot from.
#   script_dev        $script_usb|mmc_dev depending on media where boot script was found.
#   script_fsload     'fatload' or 'ext2load' depending on which was used to load boot script.
#   dram_base         DDR start address
#   dram_size         DDR size (in bytes)
#   load_addr         default load address (DDR start)
#   board             board id ("b2120", "b2260", ...)
#
# Extra commands:
#   hpen              holding pen reconfiguration and kick support, for SMP boot.
#   boot_optee        OPTEE specific boot command
#
# >
# > help boot_optee
#
#    boot_optee s_entry [s_arg0 [s_arg1 [s_arg2 [s_arg3]]]] ns_entry
#
#    - boot a secure and a non secure application
#    's_entry' is the secure application entry point
#    's_arg0-3' are the 4 parameters passed to the secure application
#    'ns_entry' is the non-secure application entry point.
#               ns_entry has no argument. Secure application is
#               expected to provide args, if any. Secure expects
#               only an physical entry point from non secure.
# >
# > help hpen
#
# hpen prepare <addr> [1stage|2stage]
#
#    - prepare a 1stage or a 2stage hpen sequence.
#      <addr> specifies the address of the hpen kicker to use. hexa.
#
# hpen kick hpen|<entrypoint>
#
#    - kick the loaded hpen. returns only once cores have all left
#      the current hpen loop.
#
#      <entrypoint> is the target address core shall branch to.
#
#      Using string "hpen" allows to enter back to the hpen sequence.
#      It allows to reprogram a specific hpen setup.
#
#     At u-boot entry, secondary boot core are placed in a 1stage hpen
#     sequence with a local ERAM cell address as hpen kicker: 0x094100A4.
#     magic value!

# Traces considerations:
#
# u-bootrom enables silent console. To get some logs from this script one
# can disable silent mode ("setenv silent;") and re-enable silent mode
# ("setenv silent 1") in this script.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is the default install: by default, boot the kernel for current board
